  # These are lockfiles with extra deps that are required to successfully build
  # the module `paloaltonetworks/postman-code-generators`, that is getting
  # pulled in by `docusaurus-theme-openapi-doc`.
  #
  # (see the repo at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/postman-code-generators)
  #
  # The vendored $name-package-lock.json files here are just the package-lock or
  # npm-shrinkwrap files of each subdirectory in the `/codegens` directory of
  # the above repo at npm version "1.1.15-patch.2".
  #
  # Note that the dependency on that postman-code-generators repo is no longer
  # present on authentik's main, but unfortunately still included in the
  # 2024.6 releases.

  # update 2024.8.0:
  #
  # The issue remains. However, now another package source  is used, namely
  # https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators at version v1.10.1
  #
  # Note:
  # Alternatively it would be possible to drop this problematic dependency
  # entirely, as is done in nixpkgs for the authentik build:
  # https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/0037d6fe7143674afdfb35d1aad315605d883973/pkgs/by-name/au/authentik/package.nix#L53
  # But this would differ from the upstream build and it's unclear what the impact is:
  # https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/version/2024.8.1/Dockerfile#L20
  # 
  # How to update:
  # These instructions may need some adjustment and are only a best effort bash 
  # translation of the nushell operations. Please correct or better create 
  # a script to automate this.
  # 
  # - remove everything from the docs-extra-package-locks folder
  # - get the postman-code-generators version from the website/package-lock.json
  # $ git clone https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators
  # $ cd postman-code-generators
  # $ git checkout v[version-from-lockfile]
  # $ cd codegens/ 
  # $ for f in **/npm-shrinkfile.json; do cp "$f" "[this projects root]/comonents/docs-extra-package-locks/${f//\//-}"
  #
